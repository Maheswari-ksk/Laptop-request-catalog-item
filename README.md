## 📝 Project Description
The **Laptop Request Catalog Item** project aims to simplify and automate the process of requesting laptops within an organization.  
Currently, the process is often manual, leading to delays, lack of standardization, and poor data tracking.  
This project addresses these challenges by creating a **Service Catalog item** that allows employees to easily request a laptop through a guided, dynamic, and automated workflow.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Employees in the organization need a quick and efficient way to request laptops for work.  
The current process is manual and prone to delays, with no dynamic form behavior to guide users or ensure accurate data collection.  

To address this, a **Service Catalog item** needs to be created, allowing users to:
- Easily request a laptop  
- Use dynamic fields and clear instructions  
- Reset the form if needed  
- Ensure all changes are tracked for governance and deployment
